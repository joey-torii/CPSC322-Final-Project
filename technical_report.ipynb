    "The dataset we used were the TV shows and movies that Netflix has to offer. Netflix has a variety of options so we thought it would be fun to crunch the numbers and see what we could learn about the possibilities. Going into the project, we believed that there were going to be a lot of areas of classification that could be done on the data. Although, when we started looking deeper into it, we realized there were less options than previously thought.\n",
