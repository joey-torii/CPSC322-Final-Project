Motivation: We both have a fascination with space and the celestial bodies that are out in the universe.

Many scientists spend a considerable amount of time determining and labeling stars. These classifications that we have done can save time when labeling the stars by taking past data and determining what the new data can be labeled as

### Description
Our project solves the problem of what a star can be classified as when it has just been discovered and has not yet been labeled.

### How to run

### How our project is organized
Our project is organized similar to our other PA's in the class. The input_data folder consists of our input data, which is the Stars.csv file. While the mysklearn folder consists of our myclassifiers.py, myevaluation.py, mypytable.py, and myutils.py files. The new MyRandomForestClassifier is within the myclassifiers.py file. The templates folder consists of the html that displays our Heroku app. All of our jupyter notebook files are outside of the folders, labeled accordingly.
