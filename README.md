Motivation: We both, along with many others, use Netflix often and were curious about the wide 
selection it has to offer.

It solves the problem of "looking for something to watch". Everyone has struggled picking out a good
movie or TV show for an occasion but can't find the right choice. So, we wanted to crunch the numbers 
to pinpoint the attributes that Netflix and the audience favors.
