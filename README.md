Motivation: We both, along with many others, use Netflix often and were curious about the wide 
selection it has to offer.

It solves the problem of "looking for something to watch". Everyone has struggled picking out a good
movie or TV show for an occasion but can't find the right choice. So, we wanted to crunch the numbers 
to pinpoint the attributes that Netflix and the audience favors.

### Description
Our project solves the problem of ratings given for movies and tv shows that Netflix has to offer. We use the MyRandomForestClassifier class to mine the data given in our netflix file. 

### How to run

### How our project is organized
Our project is organized similar to our other PA's in the class. The input_data folder consists of our input data, which is the netflix_titles.csv file. While the mysklearn folder consists of our myclassifiers.py, myevaluation.py, mypytable.py, and myutils.py files. The new MyRandomForestClassifier is within the myclassifiers.py file. All of our jupyter notebook files are outside of the folders, labeled accordingly.
